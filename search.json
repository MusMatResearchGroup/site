It specifically addresses an original concept, namely “evolutionary variation” (EV), resulted from an association between Schoenbergian principles of Grundgestalt and developing variation and some ideas from Genetics and Evolutionary Biology. The application of this concept in a compositional system (Gr-S) aims at the production of a large number of variants from a basic musical idea, covering a wide spectrum of similarity relationships. An application of EV in the composition of CTG, for woodwind trio, is described in the second part of the paper.\n\n\nKeywords: Musical and Biological Evolution.

The central properties, relations and protocols of atonal theory (complementation, inclusion, invariance, transpositional equivalence, set classification and labeling, maximal evenness) are introduced in the smallest cyclic system to which they apply. All cyclic systems of 2 to 9 elements have at least one familiar musical application, modeling beat-class (rhythmic) cycle, pentatonic and diatonic scales. By the time students have scaled up to a twelve-element universe, they are technically prepared to explore it, and to appreciate its special properties. Along the way, they have learned a model of meter, an otherwise under-theorized aspect of music pedagogy.\n\n\nKeywords: Atonality. Musical set theory.

The process is anchored on computational techniques to retrieve musical information via audio descriptors. We developed an analytical process, based on the extraction of spectral characteristics of a Sound DataBase (SDB), and on supporting the compositional planning as follows: relate statistical measures to the spectral behavior ofspecific execution modes of various instruments contained in the SDB. The result of the process is a palette of possibilities that assists the composer decisions regarding to the desired orchestration to be applied in a musical piece. The paper presents then the motivation and context to develop the environment, describes and characterizes the audio descriptors that have been studied, presents the computer system architecture and discusses the results obtained with Sound Shizuku.\n\n\nKeywords:  Composition.

Along centuries, linguists had been sufficiently discussed how breathing and cardiovascular performance set preconditions for word segmentation, phrasing, repetition, iteration, variation and expressiveness. Less attention had been paid to this influence as reflected in music, due to the belief that music can be “purely instrumental”, and therefore far away from speech. However music, dance, respiration and verbal language share common evolutionary grounds, as well as important physiological features and constraints related to the organic properties of carbon and to its role in biological evolution. In this context, this contribution interprets chemical proportions in bioorganic compounds as analogies of their musical parallels, with consequences to music theory. Mathematical evidence is suggested for sketching a carbon hypothesis of music. From this perspective, music is more a feature and a consequence of chemical and biological constraints (not exclusive of humans), than a product “purely social” or “uniquely cultural”.\n\n\nKeywords:  Carbon. 1/f Noise.

Peck\n\nAbstract: We survey the all-interval chords of small order and the interval systems in which they are situated. We begin with an examination of traditional all-interval chords in chromatic pitch-class spaces, and extend the notion of their structure to their counterparts in David Lewin’s Generalized Interval Systems. Mathematically, we observe that these chords belong to three categories of difference sets from the field of combinatorics: (v, k, 1) planar difference sets, (v, k, 2) non-planar difference sets, and (v, k, 1, t) almost difference sets. Further, we explore sets of all-interval chords in group-theoretical terms, where such sets are obtained as orbits under the action of the normalizer of the interval group. This inquiry leads to a catalog of the 11,438 all-interval chords of order k, where 2 6 k 6 8. We conclude with remarks about future work and open questions.\n\n\nKeywords:  All-interval Chords.

For this, we heuristically sketch a typology of musical qualities. Every quality offers a gamut of gradations. Each degree inside this range can be indexed as a value, making a range of quantities available. The changes of a musical quantity over time is represented as a list of values. This list can be manipulated through a variety of mathematical operations. Such approach can be applied to any musical quality (thus, encouraging students to face the elements assembled in a composition from the start). Some of these operations are presented here as functionalities of J-Syncker, an assistant software for the generation of pre-compositional material.\n\n\nKeywords:  Music Composition.

These tools are of diverse nature, depending on the theoretical needs of the problem faced. In some cases, the project employed discrete and combinatorial mathematics. In other cases, geometry was a useful tool to visualize rhythmic anipulations. Irrational numbers were the basis of a non-conventional tuning proposition. Continuous functions, like “sine”, are at the core of digital sound synthesis and, in a particular project, served to the design of a digital filter.\n\n\nKeywords:  Algorithmic composition.

This article shows how contextual inversion operations can be mapped by axes in a similar manner to In-operations, and how the positions of these axes can also be labeled. The advantage of this approach is that it will make the representation of any contextual inversion operation between members of any set class possible, which will be useful for both musical analysis and pre-compositional processes. The theoretical concepts developed in this article will be demonstrated in analyses of passages of works by Webern, Stravinsky and Villa-Lobos.\n\n\nKeywords:  Contextual inversion.

The Z-relation can be extended to pairs of setclasses; the members of the two set-classes have the same ICV, but the members of one are not related to the other under Tn or TnI. This paper shows how the 15 Z-related hexachordal setclasses can be explained by two functions on pcsets: 1) A hexachord can be described as the transpositional combination of two smaller sets; 2) A hexachord can be described as the complement union of two smaller pcsets. The 15 hexachordal pairs can be constructed by using one or more of five combinations of these two functions. For instance, the set-classes 6-10 [013457] and 6-39 [023458] are constructed by the transpositional combination of two [013] sets at the major 3rd and the complement union of a [048] trichord (augmented chord) and a [013] set.\n\n\nKeywords:  Atonal Set-theory.

This paper reviews some of the insights stemming from this application. In particular, the interplay between notes and words is explored: the words of the theory capture musical intervals, but they conveniently “forget” the notes that constitute the intervals. For the purposes of mathematical music theory, this level of abstraction is usually convenient indeed, but reinstating the notes that give life to the musical interpretation in turn enriches the formal theory. Consideration of this dichotomy leads to the mathematical opposition of commutativity vs. non-commutativity, in terms of the relations between the non-abelian free group F2 and the additive abelian group Z2, and between the free non-commutative and commutative monoids embedded, respectively, in those groups.\n\n\nKeywords:  Christoffel words.

This text is an expansion of a lecture named “A brief overview of algorithmic composition”, presented at the Music School of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in October 2019, and its main goal is to present a gentle and music-oriented introduction to Markov chains, a very intuitive and interpretable tool widely used in algorithmic composition.\n\n\nKeywords:  Markov chain.

Despite the substantial ethnographic and music-theoretic research that has been done with regard to Afro/diasporic timelines in the past sixty years, little work has explicitly attempted to define and demonstrate the would-be nature of such relationships. This article intends to stimulate a new research agenda that will close this gap between theoretical and practical knowledge. It posits four techniques (two transformational and two non-transformational) that allow one of Afro-Brazilian guitarist Baden Powell’s most rhythmically challenging recorded solos to be clearly and concisely understood as essentially six consecutive cycles of a samba timeline under various manipulations. Demonstrating the potential analytical and pedagogical economy that a theory of solo and timeline rhythmic structure relationships may underwrite, this article aims to inspire other authors to study the relationships of solo and timeline in the musics of their own specializations.\n\n\nKeywords:  Timeline.

Maia\n\nAbstract: In this work we present an analysis of Musica Ricercata I and II from the point of view of Information Theory and Complexity. We show that some patterns can be recognized and quantified using Information Theory methods such as Shannon Entropy and Statistical Correlation. In addition, we study some of Ligeti’s techniques of texture formation and their time evolution. The analysis of Movement I is more concentrated on rhythmic aspect whereas for the case of Movement II, we study phrase variations along time with their timbre variations, as well some slight modifications. For both movements a suitable alphabet of symbols and coding is introduced in order to get quantitative results for comparison and analysis. We also present some comments on the power and limitations of the approach of Information Theory for the analysis of scores. Some suggestions for further work and potential applications in music composition are also briefly discussed.\n\n\nKeywords:  György Ligeti. Musica Ricercata. Information Theory.

The impulse for reseaching cycle was made possible through a previous research, in which I proposed a conceptual framework for the relationship between music and movement in Capoeira. Here, I first discuss the idea of cycle, then its theoretical approaches, and finally, some compositional processes based on cycles.\n\n\nKeywords:  Cycle, composition. Creative Process.

For that, adequate numerical representations are required, and their use in Computer-Aided Composition (CAC) systems are presented. Numerical sequences mapping to musical elements such as pitches, durations, and articulations may be computed or hardcoded for subsequent transformation, concatenation, and superimposition. They allow the reconstruction of the segments of a given musical score. The rhythmic pattern of Clapping Music can be modeled as a group of beats being progressively deprived of one beat, each group being separated by a rest, and the sequence concatenated with its retrograde. The sequence is subsequently transformed by the successive application of “phase shifts”. A graphical interpretation of the piece is introduced using barcodes. Variations are envisaged by manipulating parameter values, each different value corresponding to a specific instance. Usually, parameters reflect compositional choices, but completely arbitrary models are possible. Such is the case of an alternative model of Clapping Music where a number is converted to binary representation and then mapped to rests and beats of eighth-notes. The manipulation of strong parameters modifies structural features of the musical score while weak parameters may only change the way the score is notated. The set of possible simulations gives rise to a space of nstances. It can be analyzed through diachronic analysis, where a small group of variations is compared to the original piece, or achronic analysis, where variations are seen as single points in the space.\n\n\nKeywords:  Algorithmic composition.

The role of number and proportion in my music is entirely dependent on the idea of music composition as cosmology, which has two aspects: the “scientific”, in which musical form is determined by formative principles or techniques, and the “contemplative”, which confers to the music an iconic relationship with mystical or mythic cosmologies such as those of the Pythagoreans and of ancient India Vedas and Vedanta. To better understand the context in which number and proportion relate to musical form in some of my works, I will first develop the ideas of composition as cosmology, composition as cosmogony, and spiral time. After this, I will briefly study the role of proportion in the temporal organization of a few key works, and conclude with some other general considerations concerning number and proportion in contemporary music. The idea of “cosmicizing sound” will surface naturally from the considerations about the poetics and aesthetics of my music.\n\n\nKeywords:  Compositional Processes. Formative Principles. Cosmology.

The plastic number of Hans van der Laan appears to be closely related to the concordance of lengths of the vital parts of a sonata-form movement of type 3 on Hepokoski and Darcy scale. Furthermore, a probabilistic model of basic variation in the structure of such movement is developed from scratch and empirically justified by analyzing instrumental works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n\n\nKeywords:  Sonata form.

Each integer partition corresponds to a specific textural configuration and is used as a tool to organize and systematize the work with textures through the compositional process. Partitional complexes, on the other hand, are sets of partitions, observed in the analysis of musical excerpts, that work in tune to create stable temporal domains where a referential partition projects, extends or presents itself as dominant. The number of partitions and complexes for a certain instrumental, vocal or electronic medium is finite and implies nestings and intersections that can provide important information about textural possibilities available to the composer. In the present work, the relationships established between distinct artitional complexes are discussed, as well as the characterization of an hierarchy related to the number of total choices that each complex offers to the composer.\n\n\nKeywords:  Partitional Analysis.

It has been the target of a large number of investigations focused on the way the composer developed a broader concept. As could it not be otherwise, his orchestral design is also closely tied to his structural concerns. However, it appears to lack a systematization of the composer’s orchestration principles. Thus, to propose an analysis of Webern’s orchestration, one need to elaborate an ad hoc method, virtually starting from scratch. This paper aims to describe the main points of this method in its current experimental stage. At the same time, we point to some conclusions about Webern’s orchestration according to his aesthetics.\n\n\nKeywords:  20th Century musicology. Webern. Variations op. 30. Textural analysis.

Existing scholarship acknowledges that these functions are similar but not identical, and researchers tend toward one or the other as a model for metric entrainment. However, if the discrete metric-weight function is converted into a continuous curve, then the two functions strongly correlate: the ordering of each beat class by its backwards discrete derivative on this curve perfectly matches the ordering of each beat class by its onset frequency in a classical corpus.\n\n\nKeywords:  Rhythm.

The motivation is in using the capacity of modern deep learning architectures and associated training and generation techniques to automatically learn styles from arbitrary corpora and then to generate samples from the estimated distribution, with some degree of control over the generation. In this article, we analyze the use of autoencoder architectures and how their ability for compressing information turns out to be an interesting source for generation of music. Autoencoders are good at representation learning, that is at extracting a compressed and abstract representation (a set of latent variables) common to the set of training examples. By choosing various instances of this abstract representation (i.e., by sampling the latent variables), we may efficiently generate various instances within the style which has been learned. Furthermore, we may use various approaches for controlling the generation, such as interpolation, attribute vector arithmetics, recursion, and objective optimization, as will be illustrated by various examples. Before concluding the article, we will discuss some limitations of autoencoders, introduce the concept of variational autoencoders, and briefly compare their respective merits and limitations for generating music.\n\n\nKeywords:  Deep learning.

The origins of this science and the definitions of its fundamental concepts are provided in the first part of the article, illustrated with musical examples. The central part of the article contains the definition of the concept of compositional system, its typology, and a series of tools that are useful for implementations. Finally, the design of three types of systems (open, semi-open and feedback) are carried out in order to produce small illustrative musical fragments.\n\n\nKeywords:  Compositional Systems.

When metric subdivisions occur that are fartheraway from the metronomic beat’s referential, (as when rhythmic deviations by many sub-ratios accumulate underneath a certain rhythmic figure), the performer experiences a cognitive loss in the sense of immediate metronomic adjacency. New ways to perform a certain rhythmic outcome buried within the grounds of complex subdivisions require mechanisms to momentarily suspend the main, overarching, beat, to impose emergent, micro-metronomes. These devices are codifiers of speeds whose regularity opens up terrain for new, rhythmical deviations and sub-ratios. They also allow the performer to negotiate between rhythms that present diverging metric configurations, linking their speeds, through rhythmic bridges. As the performer reaches these bridges, located at a deeper level of rhythmic subdivision, he/she ought to return to the main metronomic surface using the speed managed within these momentary micro-metronomes. Such performative and cognitive inversion, lies at the center of the Micro-Metric Modulation Theory.\n\n\nKeywords:  Micro-Metric Modulation. Ratios and Sub-ratios. Complex Rhythms. Micro Metronomes.

Apart from the common pitch scales we may also speak of duration and interval scales, major and minor scale schemes, ancient greek trope scale schemes. The fundamental groups of a scale (clock group and group of rows) are discussed. The principal counterpoint triple of a scale Σ consists of the operators RΣ (Σ-retrograde), TΣ (Σ-transposition) and IΣ (Σ-inversion). The group they generate will be referred to as a counterpoint group of Σ. A wide class of counterpoint triples is presented extending the composition material of n-tone music. Variations of twelve-tone pieces may be derived by applying these triples. Counterpoint spaces (CP-spaces) are reachable left actions of counterpoint groups. Such an action is actually simply transitive. Major and minor chords are defined with respect to a pair (p,q) of natural numbers playing the role of major and minor thirds respectively. It is shown that (p,q)-consonant chords in a CP-space constitute a CP-space as well.\n\n\nKeywords:  Scale. Clock and Row Groups of a Scale. Counterpoint Groups.

We show that chords, the circle of fifths, scales and certain aspects of the first species of counterpoint are encoded in the Cayley graph of the group \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\), generated by 3 and 4. Using \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\) as a model, we extend the above music concepts to a particular class of groups \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\), which displays geometric and algebraic features similar to \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\). We identify a weaker form of counterpoint which, in particular leads to Fux’s dichotomy in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_{12}\\), and to consonant sets in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_n\\). Using Maple software, we implement these new constructions and show how to experiment with them musically.\n\n\nKeywords:  Cayley graph, finitely generated group, chords, scales, circle of fifths, first species counterpoint. \n\nDownload paper"

    "text": "Papers\n\nMusic as a Carbon Language: Clarifying Methods, Results, Fresh Data and Perspectives\nGabriel Pareyon\n\nAbstract: From a cross-domain perspective, this article recapitulates fundamental concepts and procedures exposed in the antecedent homonymous paper (MusMat, first issue, 2016: 25–43). Firstly, the methodology used and here improved becomes explicit. An advanced section clarifies aspects that remained obscure in the first article. This theoretical approach falls entirely into the domain of study of the nuclear precession frequencies or Larmor frequencies in the NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) context, here incorporated to biomusicology. The structure obtained is a freescale geometric set and its generalization interprets the frequencies as a system of harmonically organized patterns. Intermediate findings provide arguments to strengthen the conjecture that the transversality of harmonic phenomena is related to a tendency towards structural self-similarity, without necessarily implying spurious relationships between causation and correlation.\n\n\nKeywords:  Larmor frequencies. Harmony theory. Self-similarity. Scale-free distribution. Biomusicology. \n\nDownload paper"

The generalization encompasses an alternative theory of contrapuntal intervals. We also propose several variations of the model that intend to deepen into its principles.

A group of algorithms were developed in order to encode drum-set timelines (as well as to retrieve the original rhythms from the codes), either individually or taken together, forming grooves. Additional parameters (dynamic levels and timbre) are also included in the encoding process. Geometrical representation of the grooves, adopting terminology and methodology proposed by Gottfried Toussaint (2013), is also provided. Some practical application, addressing analysis and composition, are suggested at the last section of the study.\n\n\nKeywords:  Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Prime encoding of rhythms.

All durations that are not involved in tuplets can be represented by sums of these fractions. The gradual transition from one note duration to another through a specified number of intermediate note values requires an accelerando/ritardando beam (i.e., feathered beam). This notation, however, does not indicate exactly how the gradual transition through the intermediate note values is to occur. The various details may be so contradictory that feathered beams may be impossible to realize. Thus, the notation is inherently indeterminate, although it is not often regarded as such. This paper examines these concepts and combines rhythmic nomenclature with a graphing system to deconstruct feathered beams using examples from George Crumb’s Night Music I.\n\n\nKeywords:  Feathered Beams.

In a nutshell, it can be understood as a visual representation of the frequency content of an audio signal as it varies with time. Here we propose a probabilistic alternative to the spectrogram, which can be roughly interpreted as the most likely frequency to be present within an audio signal, also along time. This will be achieved by computing a specific posterior distribution in a Bayesian context. Preliminary experiments indicating the suitability of this object are presented, and potential applications to audio signal processing are outlined.\n\n\nKeywords:  Audio Signal Processing.

Each textural space provides not only various ways of encoding the organization of the component parts of a texture, but also the quality of their relations. The textural class space is the most generic description of a texture as it divides the components into two abstract structures: line and block. This basic components are defined by the quality of their appearance and functionality, determined by the uniqueness versus multiplicity of the sounding components therein. The second textural space, called ordered partition space, consist of ascribing an integer partition to specify the number of components within a textural class. Finally, the partition layout space provides the most refined description of a texture among all textural space since it considers the internal order of the components according to their registral placement or timbre distribution. After presenting the various concepts and operations, the paper concludes with a discussion about the potential creative application of them, and how they can be decoded into a musical score.\n\n\nKeywords:  Musical Texture.

Then, we present how Pousseur’s Harmonic Network was implemented in SuperCollider computer language considering the algorithmic solutions to this task. Finally, we demonstrate how Harmonic Networks can be used in live electronics compositions.\n\n\nKeywords:  Pousseur’s Harmonic Network. Live-electronics.

Parsemat software runs these tasks and renders indexogram and partitiogram charts. In the present paper, we introduce the Rhythmic Partitioning Scripts (RP Scripts) as an application of Rhythmic Partitioning in the Python environment. It adds some features absent in Parsemat, such as the access to measure indications of each partition, introduction of rest handling, annotation of texture info into digital scores, and other improvements. The RP Scripts collect musical events’ locations and output locations and partitions’ data into CSV files, render indexogram/partitiogram charts, and generate annotated MusicXML score files. RP Scripts have three components: calculator (RPC), plotter (RPP), and annotator (RPA) scripts.\n\n\nKeywords:  Rhythmic Partitioning Analysis. Textural Analysis. Music Analysis. Python scripts.

The problematic elements regard 1) the formal definition of the games and 2) the limits of objective utility functions in the music domain. After introducing these games of musical strategy and the few existing practical implementations found in the literature, a detailed comparison between the mathematical models and Xenakis’s renditions is presented to highlight their divergence. Then, the feasibility from a musical perspective of the rational decision-making required by the models is explored through a computational simulation of game dynamics using Reinforcement Learning. Lastly, the article concludes by contextualising the findings to the increasingly ubiquitous role of the machine in the creative processes of musical composition and generation. In doing so, Xenakis’s original works offer themselves as a springboard for (re-)imagining and developing novel approaches integrating human-machine decision processes with musical design and interaction.\n\n\nKeywords:  Iannis Xenakis.

It explores generating up-front a knowledge base of rhythms as an alternative to generating rhythms on the fly. Since the knowledge base contains much more information than any one composing program will ever actually use, it employs ISAM technology to persist the information in one random-access file. The fundamental rhythmic entities are monophonic patterns and polyphonic textures. Patterns are defined as successions of pulse events (rests, attacks, ties). Textures present multiple patterns simultaneously. Various entity properties are calculated up front and stored alongside content data. For textures, these properties include an attack profile, which is a vector. A persistent lookup map is realized to efficiently identify textures sharing attack profiles in common. A pattern-to-pattern comparison identifies relationships which are documented in an ISAM map; these pattern-to-pattern relationships are then used to build a random-access map of texture-to-texture relationships. The article closes with a series of applications demonstrating how knowledge-base queries, random shuffling, and filtering operate to select rhythms.\n\n\nKeywords:  Composing program.

Peck\n\nAbstract: The theory of beat-class sets originates in the work of Milton Babbitt, who demonstrates a correspondence between modular pitch-class spaces and metric spaces in the framework of total serialism. Later authors, particularly Richard Cohn, John Roeder, and Robert Morris, apply similar concepts to a variety of analytical situations, drawing on concepts and procedures from pitch-class set theory. In light of the correspondence between these theories, the universe of beat-class sets for a given modulus may be partitioned into equivalence classes similar to pitch-class set classes. This study investigates processes of enumerating these equivalence classes. We consider extensions to the theory of beat-class sets by including rhythms with more than one voice. Speciﬁcally, we examine equivalence classes of multiple-voiced beat-class sets using the Power Group Enumeration Theorem (PGET) of Frank Harary and Edgar M. Palmer. The PGET allows us to determine the numbers of equivalence classes of beat-class sets as determined by various groups of transformations: metric shift, retrogradation, and voice permutation, among others. Our results have implications for further applications in pitch-class set theory, serial theory, and transformational theory.\n\n\nKeywords:  Beat-class set. Equivalence class. Combinatorics.

Some quasigroups of chords with a left (right, middle) identity element have been investigated. It is noted that the left (right, middle) identity element of a musical quasigroup is often associated with the root note of a musical chord. It is shown that chord inversions can be displayed by quasigroups. Examples of musical sequence of triads are constructed by using quasigroups. It is shown that a twelve-tone matrix can be created by using a quasigroup. Some examples of an n-tone composition chart using quasigroup are constructed. In particular, some charts showing a circle of fourths and ﬁfths have been obtained by musical quasigroup. Some examples of ascending, descending, disjunct, and conjunct motions respectively have been described using quasigroups. Also, some examples of contrary, strict contrary, oblique, similar, and parallel motions have been given using quasigroups. The bass, treble, and grand staves have been described by a quasigroup. Examples on motion of a single melody is given having both conjunct and disjunct motions. Also, an example of an oblique motion in which one of its melodies is static while the other moves into conjunct and disjunct motions is demonstrated by a quasigroup. Some examples of a subquasigroup for pitch classes are constructed and veriﬁed with some musical examples. By the concept of a normal subquasigroup, a melodic motion which is disjunct is described to have a sub-melodic motion which is conjunct. It is shown that there are paired melodies which are not in contrary motion to each other but have paired sub-melodies which are in contrary (or strict-contrary) motion.\n\n\nKeywords:  Quasigroup.

To that end, it will be necessary to determine what the main features of these graphs are and the roles that the members of each set class play in them. Each graph is related to a mode of limited transposition, which contains all the pitch classes occurring in the graph. The musical examples extracted from these graphs reveal passages in which the sets are connected by a consistent voice-leading.\n\n\nKeywords:  Neo-Riemannian theory. Graphs. Voice leading.

We return to this problem for didactic reasons, as we seek a formal solution that lends itself to automatic explanation of the way in which tonal sequences are identiﬁed. There is a search for a correspondence between the formal steps, which lead to the solution, and how a human agent does it to solve the problem him/herself. Given a sequence of chords, the task is to answer whether or not it constitutes a tonal progression, and how and why. It is an interesting problem because its formal solution, once easily automated, can give birth to educational software of real value in the case of young musicians whose access to harmony teachers is scarce or even null. This formalism applied to a large test body allows empirical proof of the fundamental idea that we can describe the tonal sequences by chaining together a minimal collection of basic tonal sequences. Students who do not have access to a harmony teacher will beneﬁt from this harmonic analysis companion.\n\n\nKeywords:  Tonality identiﬁcation. Modal semantics. Model checking.

We base all our discussion on Saint-Victor’s deﬁnition of gesture. First, we unfold it to a philosophical reﬂection that could establish a dialogue between semiotic and pre-semiotic approaches to musical gestures, thanks to Peirce’s ideas. Then we explain how the philosophical deﬁnition becomes a mathematical one, and provide reﬂections on important concepts involved in gesture theory, some possible relations to other branches of mathematics and mathematical music theory, and several open and closed questions. We include a non-mathematical discussion related to the environment of this subject and a glossary of specialized terms.\n\n\nKeywords:  Gestures. Mathematical Music Theory. Category Theory.

These results are related to the composition of the piece “Intermezzi and Capriccio” from a Fantasia, an ensemble of piano solo pieces worked from a cross analysis of the ﬁrst Intermezzo of Johannes Brahms’ Four Pieces for Piano Op. 119. In this way, the musical analysis I propose aims to compositional results, which in turn guides, the analysis itself. In this sense, the objective is not that of an analysis and modeling in order to reconstruct an original, but of analysis and modeling that allows it to unfold into new objects.\n\n\nKeywords:  Composition.

First, I discuss the paradigm of compositional choice in light of the number of variables for a given situation. Then, I introduce the concept of compositional entropy-–a proposal for measuring the amount of freedom that is implied in each compositional choice when selecting a given musical object. This computation depends on the number of available variables provided by the chosen musical object so that the higher the compositional entropy, the more complex is the choosing process as it provides a high number of possibilities to be chosen. This formulation enables the discussion of compositional choices in a view of probability and combinatorial permutations. In the second part of the article, I apply this concept in the textural domain. To do so, I introduce a series of concepts and formulations regarding musical texture to enable such a discussion. Finally, I demonstrate how to measure the compositional entropy of textures, considering both the number of possible textural configurations a composer may manage for a given number of sounding components (exhaustive taxonomy of textures) and how many different ways a given configuration can be realized as music in the score, considering only textural terms (exhaustive taxonomy of realizations).\n\n\nKeywords:  Compositional entropy.

Although much of these cultures was not clearly recorded in writing by the first European settlers, this does not mean that their existence is insignificant, and much less, that they have been lost forever. Due to the importance of publishing studies on music and mathematics from a Latin American perspective, the following text, initiatory on the subject, proposes three key questions to promote a discussion from anthropological and historical foundations for the indigenous relationships of music and mathematics, and with the intention of motivating more questions, or formulating them in a better way, in further research.\n\n\nKeywords:  Mathematical Musicology.

At the end, some basic operations (pitch, transposition, inversion, and multiplication) are defined and an illustrative musical application is provided, followed by our research prospects.\n\n\nKeywords:  Post-Tonal Music Theory.

As in many Feldman compositions of the 1950s and 60s, the first movement of the work is notated as a series of “sound events” to be played by the performer choosing the durations for each event. The only tempo indications are “Slow. Soft. Durations are free.” This situation is complicated by Feldman’s remark about a similar work from 1960, “[I chose] intervals that seemed to erase or cancel out each sound as soon as we hear the next.” I interpret this intension to keep the piece fresh and appealing from sound to sound. So, how the pianist supposed to play Last Pieces in order to supplement the composers desire for a sound to “cancel out” preceding sounds? To answer this question, I propose a way of assessing the salience of each sound event in the first movement of Last Pieces, using various means of associating each of its 43 sound events according chord spacing, register, center pitch and bandwidth, pitch intervals, pitch-classes, set-class, and figured bass. From this data, one has an idea about how to perform the work to minimize similarity relations between adjacent pairs of sound events so that they can have the cancelling effect the composer desired. As a secondary result of this analysis, many cohesive compositional relations come to light even if the work was composed “intuitively”.\n\n\nKeywords:  Morton Feldman. Musical Set Theory Analysis.

The text is divided in three sections: general background and description of Yoneda, a contextualization on Heraclitan aesthetics and polar semiotics (a notion firstly intuited by I. M. Lotman and Th. Sebeok), and an experiment suggested for the revision of the grounds of music theory, with the purpose of conciliate extremely dissociated notions of music (Euclidean vs. Heraclitan) however making part of a common musical experience and knowledge. Conclusions are addressed to hypothesize that Yoneda lemma may support a robust philosophy of music within the field of Category Theory where any group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a permutation, with one-to-one paired correspondences.\n\n\nKeywords:  Yoneda embedding.

Peck\n\nAbstract: We examine the occurrence of peripeteia in Harrison Birtwistle’s 1967 opera Punch and Judy, as manifest in a reversal of cyclic time. Specifically, we extend a metaphorical association between the passage of cyclic time in the opera and discrete rotation in the complex plane generated by the imaginary unit i. Such a rotation moves alternately between the real and the imaginary axes, as scenes in the opera pass correspondingly through sacred and profane orientations. The instance of peripeteia results in a counter rotation, a dramaturgical inversion. To bring this reversal into the metaphor, we extend it from its situation in the complex plane to one in the space of Hamilton’s quaternions, wherein such negation is obtained through the product of upper-level imaginary units. The scene that contains the reversal and that which consists of the opera’s comic resolution epitomize the drama and occupy the highest level of dramatic structure.\n\n\nKeywords:  Birtwistle. Inversion. Peripeteia. Complex numbers. Quaternions. \n\nDownload paper\n\n\nVoice Leading Among Pitch-Class Sets: Revisiting Allen Forte’s Genera\nPaulo de Tarso Salles\n\nAbstract: The theory of PC-set class genera by Allen Forte was an important contribution to the understanding of similarity relations among PC sets within the tempered system. The growing interaction between the universes of PC-sets and transformational theories has been explored the space between sets of the same or distinct cardinality, by means of voice-leading procedures. This paper intends to demonstrate Forte’s method along with proposals by other authors like Morris, Parks, Straus, Cohn, and Coelho de Souza. Some analysis demonstrates such operations in passages picked from Heitor Villa-Lobos’s works, like the Seventh String Quartet and the First Symphony.\n\n\nKeywords:  Genera. Voice leading.

This textural mode is called the Textural Proposal of a piece, where referential partitions (those that represent the main features of textural configurations in the excerpt) stand out. This conceptual environment, developed in musical texture formalization through observation and musical repertoire analysis, is now applied to musical practice. In the present work, we highlight three of these situations. The first one deals with the creative flow (compositional process) and its relation with textural planning. The second observes how these same textural functions condition the body’s physical coupling to the instrument (fingers, hands, pedals, instrumentation). Finally, just as an introduction, we envisage some spatial relations, involving instrument distribution on stage, emphasizing historical concert music.\n\n\nKeywords:  Texture. Partitional Analysis.

In this new research, we aim to concentrate on Compositional Planning, which draws from a diverse range of paradigms (including interdisciplinarity), as a concept that interweaves textual and musical reflections and productions. This approach will extend the activities carried out in the two prior projects, which resulted in a significant output of bibliographic and compositional materials, laying the groundwork for the exploration we now propose."

    "text": "Research\nMusical Texture as a Systematic Tool for Composition and Analysis\nIn this research project, we aim to continue the compositional research on texture initiated in my Doctoral thesis (Textural Design: A compositional theory for the organization of musical texture), in which I formulated what I call “textural design” - “[…] a pre-compositional methodology for organizing the various textural configurations of a piece in an abstract structure ready to be implemented as music. This concept is a translation (or adaptation) of Morris’ compositional design into the realm of musical texture. Since Morris’ proposal deals with distinct musical elements, some of his properties could not be fully applied, while other original possibilities were developed specifically for this research. For the formulation of textural design, the concept of textural space was developed, providing a series of codes that describe various musical textures. Each code differs from the others in its level of descriptive refinement. This research seeks to systematize new tools for manipulating and organizing texture, which can also be applied to the analysis of various works in the repertoire. This expansion is being developed both from original ideas specifically designed for musical texture and its unique characteristics, and through the adaptation of concepts from the poetics of musical creation related to different musical parameters. Additionally, this research aims to apply the tools developed in the realm of texture to other musical parameters, such as intervals, pitches, pitch classes, durations, etc. In this expansion of scope, the concept of Partition Space was created. This consists of a generalization of textural spaces to encompass any musical parameter that can be partitioned in some way. Finally, this research also seeks to develop computational tools to assist both the creative and analytical use of the developed tools and concepts."
