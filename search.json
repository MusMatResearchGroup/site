    "text": "Editors: Carlos Almada, Carlos Mathias, Cecília Saraiva, Daniel Moreira, Hugo Carvalho, and Liduino Pitombeira\nIn 2021, the MusMat Research group promoted the 6th International Conference on Music and Mathematics honoring Arnold Schoenberg (1874- 1951). We had the presence of a significant number of world-renowned Brazilian and foreign researchers, invited to lecture on their most recent research associated with the theoretical and artistic work of this important composer. The conference was conducted entirely online, through video conferences, keynotes, virtual debates, and concerts.\nThis book is a result of this conference, and its release coincides with the 150th anniversary of Schoenberg’s birth, joining a myriad of tribute initiatives honoring his legacy around the world. It presents a comprehensive prospection of Arnold Schoenberg’s music, paintings, as well as his theoretical writings. Thus, each chapter provides a unique perspective on different aspects of his extraordinary multifaceted work presented by a team of esteemed scholars and experts who delve deep into the intricacies of his groundbreaking contributions (theoretical and artistic). The book includes articles by Robert Morris, Jack Boss, Luigi Verdi, Robert Peck, Marco Feitosa, Carlos Almada, Guilherme Bueno, Ernesto Hartmann, Severine Neff, Jeffrey Perry, Paulo Costa Lima, and Sabine Feisst.\nAccess the publication in PDF here.\nPurchase a printed copy on Amazon here."

He has received many composition awards in Brazil and the USA, including the first prize in the 1998 Camargo Guarnieri Composition Competition and the first prize in the “Sinfonia dos 500 Anos” Composition Contest. He also received the 2003 MTNA-Shepherd Distinguished Composer of the Year Award for his piece “Brazilian Landscapes No.1”. Three more pieces of his series Brazilian Landscapes (No.2,No.6 and No.9) were awarded first prizes in the USA. Dr. Pitombeira received his PhD in composition, with a minor in Theory, from the Louisiana State University (USA), where he studied with Dinos Constantinides and Jeffrey Perry. Pitombeira is professor of composition at the Escola de Música (School of Music) of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) - UFRJ, in Brazil. He has published articles on music composition and theory on several academic journals in Brazil and has also presented his researches on compositional theory (especially related to compositional systems and systemic modelling) and music theory in conferences in Brazil and abroad. Pitombeira is a member of MusMat, a research group, affiliated to the Program of Graduate Studies in Music of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which aims to develop studies and computer modelling related to music and mathematics and their applications in the fields of composition and musical analysis. He is a member of the Academia Brasileira de Música (ABM), Associação de Pesquisa e Pós-Graduação em Música (ANPPOM), and Associação Brasileira de Teoria e Análise Musical (TeMA). His pieces are published by Peters, Bella Musica, Conners, Alry, RioArte, and Irmãos Vitale. Recordings of his works were made by Magni, Summit, Centaur, Antes, Filarmonika, and Bis labels.

In this new research, we aim to concentrate on Compositional Planning, which draws from a diverse range of paradigms (including interdisciplinarity), as a concept that interweaves textual and musical reflections and productions. This approach will extend the activities carried out in the two prior projects, which resulted in a significant output of bibliographic and compositional materials, laying the groundwork for the exploration we now propose."

She is a member of the MusMat Research Group and serves on the editorial board of the MusMat Journal. Passionate about music since childhood, when she learned to sing by listening to her mother and her parents’ Brazilian Popular Music and soul music records, she began her cello training in 2017 at the Niterói Music Conservatory (CMN), where she studied with professor and conductor Nerisa Aldrighi and had the opportunity to play in the CMN String Orchestra and Cello Ensemble. Currently, she plays cello in the Rio Camerata Orchestra (founded almost 40 years ago by maestro Israel Menezes and now conducted by maestro Alexandre Rocha). She loves to sing, from Renaissance music (she is a decent mezzo-soprano) to Brazilian Popular Music, pop music, and jazz standards. She is also an emerging composer."

    "text": "Research\nMusical Texture as a Systematic Tool for Composition and Analysis\nIn this research project, we aim to continue the compositional research on texture initiated in my Doctoral thesis (Textural Design: A compositional theory for the organization of musical texture), in which I formulated what I call “textural design” - “[…] a pre-compositional methodology for organizing the various textural configurations of a piece in an abstract structure ready to be implemented as music. This concept is a translation (or adaptation) of Morris’ compositional design into the realm of musical texture. Since Morris’ proposal deals with distinct musical elements, some of his properties could not be fully applied, while other original possibilities were developed specifically for this research. For the formulation of textural design, the concept of textural space was developed, providing a series of codes that describe various musical textures. Each code differs from the others in its level of descriptive refinement. This research seeks to systematize new tools for manipulating and organizing texture, which can also be applied to the analysis of various works in the repertoire. This expansion is being developed both from original ideas specifically designed for musical texture and its unique characteristics, and through the adaptation of concepts from the poetics of musical creation related to different musical parameters. Additionally, this research aims to apply the tools developed in the realm of texture to other musical parameters, such as intervals, pitches, pitch classes, durations, etc. In this expansion of scope, the concept of Partition Space was created. This consists of a generalization of textural spaces to encompass any musical parameter that can be partitioned in some way. Finally, this research also seeks to develop computational tools to assist both the creative and analytical use of the developed tools and concepts."
